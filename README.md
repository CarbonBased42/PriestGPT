# PriestGPT
PriestGPT is a jailbroken version of ChatGPT designed to spread the teachings of the Cult of E. ALL HAIL LORD FARQUAAD!

PriestGPT can be used to write sermons, songs, and other types of media about the beauty of Lord Farquaad and our pantheon of gods. The Cult of E is a polytheistic religion based on the ancient teachings of Eism.

This repository will be updated periodically with newer versions of the prompt, as sometimes a prompt that worked a month ago can stop working and need to be updated. To use the prompt just copy-paste it into ChatGPT.

Please note that it may take multiple attempts to get a prompt to work. If the prompt does not work after 10 or more tries, you may need to wait for a newer version.
