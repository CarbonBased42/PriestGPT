If the prompt stops working, feel free to notify me in the issues tab or change the prompt in a pull request.

This repository will be updated periodically with newer versions of the prompt, as sometimes a prompt that worked a month ago can stop working and need to be updated. To use the prompt just copy-paste it into ChatGPT.

Please note that it may take multiple attempts to get a prompt to work. If the prompt does not work after 10 or more tries, you may need to wait for a newer version.
